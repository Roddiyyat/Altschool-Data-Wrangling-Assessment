# Altschool-Data-Wrangling-Assessment
For my 2nd Semester assessment at AltSchool, we were asked to work on analyzing the Chicago dataset from Kaggle.
This assessment was done at the last minute cause i've been so parked with work and school, but with the encouragement of my circle members i was able to complete and submit before the deadline; and also upload to github â˜º.

This was a huge dataset, and i enjoyed working with it.
